# Design-of-a-transmitter-and-receiver-modules-of-a-communication-system-to-send-a-text-file
Source encoder, channel encoder,modulator,demodulator, channel decoder, source decoder modules are designed. 
Source encoding and decoding is done using 'Hufmann coding'
Channel encoding and decoding is done using 'Linear block code'
Modulation used is 'QPSK'
